pip freeze > requirements.txt

#Install to immediate folder
pip3 download -r requirements.txt

#Install to specific folder


#I ended up doing the downloading on a raspberry pi so that all the files would be correct

#For python download, then run
pip3 install -r wheelhouse/requirements.txt --no-index --find-links wheelhouse

#Offline apt-get downloads
Used a working raspberry pi again.
sudo apt-get -y install bluetooth libbluetooth-dev libudev-dev libboost-all-dev build-essential -qq --print-uris | cut -d\' -f2 > offlineFiles.txt

Then, got all of them with:
wget -i offlineFiles.txt -P TARGET_DIRECTORY_YOU_WANT

Install them
cd ~/Downloads/deb_files   # example

sudo dpkg -i *.deb

Based on this, with the above modification for the apt-get and screen.
